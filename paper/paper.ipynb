The trade-off between doxxing and helping save the planet by inducing a new type of energy usage into the competitive computing industry is worth it. Also, I liked doing a podcast, so please invite me over. you can contact me on twitter/X @bluecow009 or my public email 0xbluecow@protonmail.com, I check it everyday.\n",
