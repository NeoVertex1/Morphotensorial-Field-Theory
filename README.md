# Morphotensorial-Field-Theory
Morphotensorial Field Theory (MFT): A mathematical framework unifying complex tensor operations, quantum fields, and scale-invariant transformations. Introduces the Morphing Infinity Spiral transformation for studying dynamic field systems with applications in quantum visualization and electromagnetic analysis.
