# Morphotensorial-Field-Theory
Morphotensorial Field Theory (MFT): A mathematical framework unifying complex tensor operations, quantum fields, and scale-invariant transformations. Introduces the Morphing Infinity Spiral transformation for studying dynamic field systems with applications in quantum visualization and electromagnetic analysis.


you can find the paper in progress here https://github.com/NeoVertex1/Morphotensorial-Field-Theory/blob/main/paper/paper.ipynb

download it and run it on a jupyter or colab session, it should work with cpu, the MIS main data dumps prefer GPU (CUDA)
